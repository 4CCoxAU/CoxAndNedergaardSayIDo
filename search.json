    "text": "Our Love Story\nIt was our dedication to nerdiness that first brought us together in the autumn of 2019. Being the only two new PhD students at our department, we naturally gravitated towards each other and soon discovered a shared love of silly shenanigans and Noam Chomsky. Before long, we realised that we had an almost eerily number of things in common ‚Äì we both felt emotionally and culturally connected to the UK and Denmark, we both played the violin, and both were passionately interested in language and the mind. The feeling of being understood at so many levels felt magical.\nA few months after we met, Johanne plucked up the courage to tell Chris that she liked him in a ‚Äúnon-platonic‚Äù way. To nobody else‚Äôs great surprise and to all of our guests‚Äô luck next summer, he reciprocated. The relationship took off like a rocket, largely thanks to a certain pandemic that prevented us from spending most of our first year separately abroad for research stays and conferences. A year after we got together, we bought our flat in Aarhus and started our blissful co-existence. Aarhus became our base for many adventures both together and separately, and soon it will function as our base for building a family."

Our hope is to create a laid-back, informal atmosphere filled with music, games, and all sorts of entertainment.\nSome parts of the celebration will be in English, and others in Danish. If any of our non-Danish guests look a bit confused, we kindly ask our Danish friends to help out and explain what‚Äôs going on.\nChildren are more than welcome (we‚Äôll probably have our one with us!), and we‚Äôve planned some fun activities for them, like treasure hunts and other games.\nExpect plenty of fun, delicious food, and a dance floor that will stay busy well into the night. From the moment you arrive, we want you to feel welcome and hope you feel the joy and excitement we‚Äôre feeling. Most of all, we just want everyone to have a fantastic time celebrating this fun time in our lives!"

If you‚Äôre arriving in Denmark by plane, the easiest destination would be Billund Lufthavn. From there, you can rent a car, or take a three-hour train to Snedsted where we‚Äôll come and pick you up."

Chris, altid en gentleman, havde en kaffe i den ene h√•nd og en stak b√∏ger i den anden, da han pludselig ‚Äì bam ‚Äì st√∏dte lige ind i Johanne. Kaffen fl√∏j, b√∏gerne v√¶ltede, og sk√¶bnen, som man siger, var beseglet.\nFra det √∏jeblik vidste Chris, at Johanne var noget helt s√¶rligt. Han blev betaget af hendes glimtende √∏jne, smittende latter og den m√•de, hun smilede p√•, selv n√•r hans klodsethed var tydelig. Johanne kunne heller ikke undg√• at blive charmeret af Chris‚Äô akavede, men s√∏de fors√∏g p√• at g√∏re det godt igen efter den spildte kaffe ‚Äì og det f√∏rte til deres f√∏rste officielle date.\nDen date blev til mange flere, fyldt med latter, eventyr og lange samtaler om alt fra dr√∏mme til pizzafyld (de diskuterer stadig fordelene ved ananas!). Sammen opdagede de deres k√¶rlighed til spontane roadtrips, natlige dansefester i k√∏kkenet og maratonvisninger af d√•rlige romantiske komedier.\nEfter utallige minder og en k√¶rlighed, der kun blev st√¶rkere, besluttede Chris at fri p√• den mest Chris-agtige m√•de: mens han fors√∏gte (og fejlede) at lave Johannes livret. Hun sagde ja mellem bidder af let br√¶ndt pasta, og resten, som man siger, er historie.\nNu inviterer vi jer til at fejre det n√¶ste kapitel i vores k√¶rlighedshistorie, n√•r vi siger ‚Äúja‚Äù og begynder vores evige eventyr sammen. Hvad vi forestiller os for vores bryllupsdag\nVi √∏nsker, at vores bryllupsdag skal v√¶re fyldt med k√¶rlighed, latter og uforglemmelige √∏jeblikke. Fra det √∏jeblik, I ankommer, til den sidste dans, h√•ber vi, at I vil m√¶rke den gl√¶de og sp√¶nding, vi f√∏ler. Forvent masser af sjov, l√¶kker mad og et dansegulv, der vil v√¶re fyldt langt ud p√• natten. Mest af alt √∏nsker vi bare, at alle har en fantastisk tid med at fejre dette s√¶rlige kapitel i vores liv! Hvad skal der ske p√• dagen?\nVi har en dag pakket med k√¶rlighed og fest, og vi gl√¶der os s√• meget til at dele den med jer! Her er, hvad I kan forvente:\n\nCeremoni ‚Äì Hvor vi siger ‚Äúja‚Äù og pr√∏ver at lade v√¶re med at gr√¶de for meget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVi k√∏rer til Kalkv√¶rksvej 20 ‚Äì En sjov 4-minutters roadtrip til vores n√¶ste destination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVi fester igennem ‚Äì Du ved, hvad det betyder.
