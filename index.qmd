It all started with a chance encounter on a breezy autumn afternoon. Chris, ever the gentleman, was juggling a coffee in one hand and an armful of books in the other, when out of nowhere â€“ bam â€“ he bumped right into Johanne. Coffee flew, books tumbled, and fate, as they say, was sealed.

From that moment on, Chris knew Johanne was someone special. He was captivated by her sparkling eyes, infectious laugh, and the way she smiled even when his clumsiness was on full display. Johanne, meanwhile, couldnâ€™t help but be charmed by Chrisâ€™s awkwardly adorable attempts to make up for the spilled coffee â€“ which led to their first official date.

That date turned into many more, filled with laughter, adventures, and long conversations about everything from dreams to pizza toppings (they still debate the merits of pineapple!). Together, they discovered their love for spontaneous road trips, late-night dance parties in the kitchen, and binge-watching terrible rom-coms.

After countless memories made and love only growing stronger, Chris decided to pop the question in the most Chris way possible: while attempting (and failing) to cook Johanneâ€™s favorite meal. She said yes between bites of slightly burnt pasta, and the rest, as they say, is history.

Now, we invite you to join us in celebrating the next chapter of our love story as we say "I do" and begin our forever adventure together.
