## Our Love Story
It was our dedication to nerdiness that first brought us together in the autumn of 2019. Being the only two new PhD students at our department, we naturally gravitated towards each other and soon discovered a shared love of silly shenanigans and Noam Chomsky. Before long, we realised that we had an almost eerily number of things in common – we both felt emotionally and culturally connected to the UK and Denmark, we both enjoyed reading weighty, books, both played the violin, and both were passionately interested in language and the mind. The feeling of being understood at so many levels felt magical. 

A few months after we met, Johanne plucked up the courage to tell Chris that she liked him in a “non-platonic” way. To nobody else’s great surprise and to all of our guests’ luck next summer, he reciprocated. The relationship took off like a rocket, largely thanks to a certain pandemic that prevented us from spending most of our first year separately abroad for research stays and conferences. A year after we got together, we bought our flat in Aarhus and started our blissful co-existence. Aarhus became our base for many adventures both together and separately, and soon it will function as our base for building a family.

## What we envision for our wedding day
We've both dreamt about bringing together everyone that we've been lucky enough to meet on our adventures through time and space - from high school friends to AirBnB hosts, childhood buddies to crazy cousins. From the moment you arrive, we want you to feel welcome and hope you feel the joy and excitement we’re feeling. Expect plenty of fun, delicious food, and a dance floor that will stay busy well into the night. Children are more than welcome (we'll be bringing our own), and we've arranged some games for them. Most of all, we just want everyone to have a fantastic time celebrating this fun time in our lives!

## What will be happening on the day?

We’ve got a day packed with love and celebration, and we’re so excited to share it with you! Here’s what you can expect:
  
* Ceremony at Nørhå Church – Where we say "I do" and try not to cry too much.

* We drive to Kalkværksvej 20 – A fun 4-minute road trip to our next destination: Lærkely (Johanne's Mum's Home)

  addMarkers(lng = 8.396672, lat = 56.898276, popup = "Lærkely (Johanne's Mum's Home)")
```


## Where is Thy? And how do I get there?
Thy is an area in the north west of Jutland known for its unbelievably beautiful, raw, and unique natural environment. This was where Johanne was lucky enough to grow up and we've always thought that it would be the perfect place to celebrate our wedding. 

For the international guests, you may be thinking: how on Earth am I going to get to Thy and where am I going to stay? If you're arriving in Denmark by plane, the easiest destination would be Billund Lufthavn. From there, you can rent a car, or take a three-hour train to Snedsted where we'll come and pick you up.

## Where can we stay in Stenbjerg, Thy?

Stenbjerg is a small place (just to give you an idea, there wasn't even electricity there until the 1970s). We have therefore secured deals with almost all available accommodation within a 5km radius of Lærkely. Specifically, we have arranged accommodation at the following cozy places at a flat rate of 350kr.:

* Stenbjerg Kro.
* Stone Mountain Bed & Breakfast.
* Fiskerhuset Bed & Breakfast.
* Strandfogedgården (700kr. for 14 people).
* Stay with a Thy Local (Annette or Lisbeth).
* 2 AirBnbs.

If you know that you need accommodation when arriving in Thy, let us know and we will arrange it for you as well as transport to and from Lærkely.

## What about presents?
We want no other presents than your presence. We’re just so happy to have you with us to celebrate. A lot of you are travelling from afar -- be it from India, England, or even Copenhagen!

## Dresscode
We’re aiming for a ‘dress to impress’ vibe - stylish yet comfortable! The main celebrations will be in a tent (with heating). Whether it’s a sharp outfit or a beautiful ensemble, we trust you’ll strike the perfect balance for the day with a look that suits both the celebration and the weather.

Please answer as soon as possible.
